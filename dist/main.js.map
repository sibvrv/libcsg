If two CSG solids of n polygons are unified, the resulting solid may have\nin the order of n*n polygons, because each polygon is split by the planes of all other\npolygons. After a few operations the number of polygons explodes.\n\nThis version of CSG.js solves the problem in 3 ways:\n\n1. Every polygon split is recorded in a tree (CSG.PolygonTreeNode). This is a separate\ntree, not to be confused with the CSG tree. If a polygon is split into two parts but in\nthe end both fragments have not been discarded by the CSG operation, we can retrieve\nthe original unsplit polygon from the tree, instead of the two fragments.\n\nThis does not completely solve the issue though: if a polygon is split multiple times\nthe number of fragments depends on the order of subsequent splits, and we might still\nend up with unncessary splits:\nSuppose a polygon is first split into A and B, and then into A1, B1, A2, B2. Suppose B2 is\ndiscarded. We will end up with 2 polygons: A and B1. Depending on the actual split boundaries\nwe could still have joined A and B1 into one polygon. Therefore a second approach is used as well:\n\n2. After CSG operations all coplanar polygon fragments are joined by a retesselating\noperation. See CSG.reTesselated(). Retesselation is done through a\nlinear sweep over the polygon surface. The sweep line passes over the y coordinates\nof all vertices in the polygon. Polygons are split at each sweep line, and the fragments\nare joined horizontally and vertically into larger polygons (making sure that we\nwill end up with convex polygons).\nThis still doesn't solve the problem completely: due to floating point imprecisions\nwe may end up with small gaps between polygons, and polygons may not be exactly coplanar\nanymore, and as a result the retesselation algorithm may fail to join those polygons.\nTherefore:\n\n3. A canonicalization algorithm is implemented: it looks for vertices that have\napproximately the same coordinates (with a certain tolerance, say 1e-5) and replaces\nthem with the same vertex. If polygons share a vertex they will actually point to the\nsame CSG.Vertex instance. The same is done for polygon planes. See CSG.canonicalized().\n\nPerformance improvements to the original CSG.js:\n\nReplaced the flip() and invert() methods by flipped() and inverted() which don't\nmodify the source object. This allows to get rid of all clone() calls, so that\nmultiple polygons can refer to the same CSG.Plane instance etc.\n\nThe original union() used an extra invert(), clipTo(), invert() sequence just to remove the\ncoplanar front faces from b; this is now combined in a single b.clipTo(a, true) call.\n\nDetection whether a polygon is in front or in back of a plane: for each polygon\nwe are caching the coordinates of the bounding sphere. If the bounding sphere is\nin front or in back of the plane we don't have to check the individual vertices\nanymore.\n\nOther additions to the original CSG.js:\n\nCSG.Vector class has been renamed into CSG.Vector3D\n\nClasses for 3D lines, 2D vectors, 2D lines, and methods to find the intersection of\na line and a plane etc.\n\nTransformations: CSG.transform(), CSG.translate(), CSG.rotate(), CSG.scale()\n\nExpanding or contracting a solid: CSG.expand() and CSG.contract(). Creates nice\nsmooth corners.\n\nThe vertex normal has been removed since it complicates retesselation. It's not needed\nfor solid CAD anyway.\n\n*/\n\nconst {addTransformationMethodsToPrototype, addCenteringToPrototype} = require('./core/mutators');\nlet CSG = require('./core/CSG');\nlet CAG = require('./core/CAG');\n\n// FIXME: how many are actual usefull to be exposed as API ?? looks like a code smell\nconst {\n  _CSGDEBUG,\n  defaultResolution2D,\n  defaultResolution3D,\n  EPS,\n  angleEPS,\n  areaEPS,\n  all,\n  top,\n  bottom,\n  left,\n  right,\n  front,\n  back,\n  staticTag,\n  getTag\n} = require('./core/constants');\n\nCSG._CSGDEBUG = _CSGDEBUG;\nCSG.defaultResolution2D = defaultResolution2D;\nCSG.defaultResolution3D = defaultResolution3D;\nCSG.EPS = EPS;\nCSG.angleEPS = angleEPS;\nCSG.areaEPS = areaEPS;\nCSG.all = all;\nCSG.top = top;\nCSG.bottom = bottom;\nCSG.left = left;\nCSG.right = right;\nCSG.front = front;\nCSG.back = back;\nCSG.staticTag = staticTag;\nCSG.getTag = getTag;\n\n// eek ! all this is kept for backwards compatibility...for now\nCSG.Vector2D = require('./core/math/Vector2');\nCSG.Vector3D = require('./core/math/Vector3');\nCSG.Vertex = require('./core/math/Vertex3');\nCAG.Vertex = require('./core/math/Vertex2');\nCSG.Plane = require('./core/math/Plane');\nCSG.Polygon = require('./core/math/Polygon3');\nCSG.Polygon2D = require('./core/math/Polygon2');\nCSG.Line2D = require('./core/math/Line2');\nCSG.Line3D = require('./core/math/Line3');\nCSG.Path2D = require('./core/math/Path2');\nCSG.OrthoNormalBasis = require('./core/math/OrthoNormalBasis');\nCSG.Matrix4x4 = require('./core/math/Matrix4');\n\nCAG.Side = require('./core/math/Side');\n\nCSG.Connector = require('./core/connectors').Connector;\nCSG.ConnectorList = require('./core/connectors').ConnectorList;\nCSG.Properties = require('./core/Properties');\n\nconst {circle, ellipse, rectangle, roundedRectangle} = require('./primitives/csg/primitives2d');\nconst {sphere, cube, roundedCube, cylinder, roundedCylinder, cylinderElliptic, polyhedron} = require('./primitives/csg/primitives3d');\n\nCSG.sphere = sphere;\nCSG.cube = cube;\nCSG.roundedCube = roundedCube;\nCSG.cylinder = cylinder;\nCSG.roundedCylinder = roundedCylinder;\nCSG.cylinderElliptic = cylinderElliptic;\nCSG.polyhedron = polyhedron;\n\nCAG.circle = circle;\nCAG.ellipse = ellipse;\nCAG.rectangle = rectangle;\nCAG.roundedRectangle = roundedRectangle;\n\n// injecting factories\nconst {fromPolygons, fromCompactBinary, fromObject, fromSlices} = require('./core/CSGFactories');\nCSG.fromCompactBinary = fromCompactBinary;\nCSG.fromObject = fromObject;\nCSG.fromSlices = fromSlices;\nCSG.fromPolygons = fromPolygons;\n\nconst CAGFactories = require('./core/CAGFactories');\nCAG.fromSides = CAGFactories.fromSides;\nCAG.fromObject = CAGFactories.fromObject;\nCAG.fromPoints = CAGFactories.fromPoints;\nCAG.fromPointsNoCheck = CAGFactories.fromPointsNoCheck;\nCAG.fromPath2 = CAGFactories.fromPath2;\nCAG.fromFakeCSG = CAGFactories.fromFakeCSG;\nCAG.fromCompactBinary = CAGFactories.fromCompactBinary;\n\n/// ////////////////////////////////////\n// option parsers\nconst optionsParsers = require('./api/optionParsers');\n\n// ////////////////////////////////////\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.Vector2D.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.Vector3D.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.Vertex.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.Plane.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.Polygon.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.Line2D.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.Line3D.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.Path2D.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.OrthoNormalBasis.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CSG.Connector.prototype);\n\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CAG.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CAG.Side.prototype);\naddTransformationMethodsToPrototype(CAG.Vertex.prototype);\n\nCSG.parseOptionAs2DVector = optionsParsers.parseOptionAs3DVector;\nCSG.parseOptionAs3DVector = optionsParsers.parseOptionAs3DVector;\nCSG.parseOptionAs3DVectorList = optionsParsers.parseOptionAs3DVectorList;\nCSG.parseOptionAsBool = optionsParsers.parseOptionAsBool;\nCSG.parseOptionAsFloat = optionsParsers.parseOptionAsFloat;\nCSG.parseOptionAsInt = optionsParsers.parseOptionAsInt;\n// this is needed for now, otherwise there are missing features in Polygon2D\nCSG.Polygon2D.prototype = CAG.prototype;\n\n// utilities\nconst {isCAG, isCSG} = require('./core/utils');\n\nconst globalApi = Object.assign({}, {CSG, CAG}, optionsParsers, {isCAG, isCSG});\n\nmodule.exports = globalApi;\n","const Vector2D = require('./Vector2');\nconst {solve2Linear} = require('../utils');\n\n/**  class Line2D\n * Represents a directional line in 2D space\n * A line is parametrized by its normal vector (perpendicular to the line, rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise)\n * and w.
