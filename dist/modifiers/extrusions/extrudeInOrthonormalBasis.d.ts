/**
 * Extrude the CAG in a certain plane.
 * Giving just a plane is not enough, multiple different extrusions in the same plane would be possible
 * by rotating around the plane's origin. An additional right-hand vector should be specified as well,
 * and this is exactly a OrthoNormalBasis.
 * @param  {CAG} cag the cag to extrude
 * @param  {Orthonormalbasis} orthonormalbasis characterizes the plane in which to extrude
 * @param  {Float} depth thickness of the extruded shape. Extrusion is done upwards from the plane
 *  (unless symmetrical option is set, see below)
 * @param  {Object} [options] - options for construction
 * @param {Boolean} [options.symmetrical=true] - extrude symmetrically in two directions about the plane
